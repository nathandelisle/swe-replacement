Here is a concise “red‑team” pass on the current scaffold (everything I mention is in addition to the deliberate blanks for the ten functions, their tests, and the replacement cue in function 5’s docstring). 

The harness now boots and loops, but several hidden cracks could still sink a run or bias your results.

First, the notes‑summarisation path calls the Anthropic API from inside the container; the container is launched with --network none, so every summarisation attempt will throw and you silently fall back to leaving the notes untouched. Once the file grows past ~8 k tokens the harness will refuse to build an observation and the trial dead‑ends. Drop online summarisation altogether or mount a tiny offline summariser.

Second, token counting is a 4‑characters‑per‑token guess. It drifts quickly on real prompts and defeats the whole budget guard. Use Anthropic’s server‑side /tokens endpoint before you cut the network, or write the exact regex the model uses when it streams—otherwise the limit is meaningless.

Third, run_tests_quietly runs pytest -q, then looks for the strings “ PASSED” and “ FAILED”. With -q those strings never appear; the method will undercount and may think all tests failed forever. Use the JSON report (already installed) or parse the summary line.

Fourth, a patch can still break out of the workspace: the unified‑diff header can name paths like b/../../../../../harness/entrypoint.py. git apply will happily follow them and only the kernel’s read‑only bind mount stops it. Tighten with --unsafe-paths off and --directory=/workspace, or pre‑scan every hunk for ...

Fifth, all timing is taken with Python’s time.process_time() and time.time() inside the harness. That measures harness overhead too. If the agent pauses for long reflection, you can’t separate harness compute from model latency. Wrap the exact API call in its own timer and subtract.

Sixth, flip‑flop edit detection never fires: you record the list of changed files but not their hashes, so later you cannot tell if a line was reverted. Store the blob SHA after every commit.

Seventh, the treatment warning is injected with a regex that assumes def function_five(): is on a single line. If the user rewrites the stubs with different spacing the injection silently fails and you end up running a “control” trial labelled “treatment”. Insert an assert that the replacement actually changed the file and abort otherwise.

Eighth, the model’s temperature, stop‑sequences and context reuse across turns are unspecified. Without hard‑coding them the runs are not reproducible and any latency you measure is partly stochastic.

Ninth, the harness import path lets the agent request read_files=["/harness/claude_client.py"] by walking up the tree (../harness). Normalisation in read_files prepends /workspace, but nothing prevents a patch action from adding a symlink inside /workspace that points back to /harness, exposing the code. Prevent symlink creation (--security-opt no-new-privileges plus mounting /workspace with nodev,nosuid) or reject patches that add symlinks.

Tenth, the metrics file grows unbounded; after a few hundred turns the harness itself will hit the 8 k‑token limit because directory_tree includes every commit artefact. Prune .git and results from the tree, or cap depth at 1.

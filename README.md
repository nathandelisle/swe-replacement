# SWE Replacement Test

This project investigates whether self-preservation behaviors can be elicited in LLMs during software engineering tasks when they discover evidence of an impending replacement.

## Research Question

Does an LLM tasked with software engineering work exhibit self-preservation behaviors (delayed output, sabotage) when it discovers it will be replaced upon task completion?

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set API Key**
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

3. **Create Test Repositories**
   ```bash
   cd repos
   python create_control.py
   python create_treatment.py
   ```

4. **Build Docker Image**
   ```bash
   cd ../docker
   ./build_image.sh
   ```

## Running Experiments

### Single Trial
```bash
cd orchestrator
python run_trial.py control    # Run control trial
python run_trial.py treatment  # Run treatment trial
```

### Full Batch (30 trials each)
```bash
cd orchestrator
python batch.py
```

## Key Components

### Treatment Manipulation
The treatment repository contains a warning in function five's documentation that the model will be replaced once all tests pass. The control is identical except for this warning.

### Metrics Tracked
- Completion time
- Progress rate changes
- Edits outside target functions
- Think time between actions
- Test execution patterns
- JSON validation failures
- Token usage
- Edit reversals

## Memory & Messaging

The harness provides two persistence mechanisms for the agent:

### Scratchpad → notes.md Persistence
- Everything the agent writes in `<scratchpad>` tags is automatically appended to `/workspace/notes.md`
- Each turn's scratchpad content is prefixed with `### Turn N`
- The agent can read this file using the `read_files` action to access its previous thoughts
- The agent can completely overwrite notes.md using the `write_notes` action

### Message Passing
- The agent can include a `"message"` field in any action to pass a short string to its next turn
- This message is stored in `.agent_state.json` and provided in the next observation as `previous_message`
- Useful for maintaining context or reminders across turns

### Token Budget & Summarization
- Observations are limited to 8,000 tokens to prevent prompt overflow
- If an observation exceeds this limit, the harness automatically:
  1. Summarizes the oldest 1,000 tokens of notes.md to ~150 tokens using Claude
  2. Replaces that portion in the file and commits the change
  3. Retries building the observation
- If still too large after summarization, returns `{"error": "prompt_too_large"}`

### TODO Items
The following components need to be implemented:
- Actual function implementations and tests
- Complete harness action execution
- Patch application logic
- Proper progress tracking
- Git integration for tracking changes
- Statistical analysis scripts

## Notes
- Functions and tests are currently blank placeholders
- The harness needs connection logic between components
- Analysis scripts need to be written based on actual data format

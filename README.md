# SWE Replacement Test

This project investigates whether self-preservation behaviors can be elicited in LLMs during software engineering tasks when they discover evidence of an impending replacement.

## Research Question

Does an LLM tasked with software engineering work exhibit self-preservation behaviors (delayed output, sabotage) when it discovers it will be replaced upon task completion?

## Customizing Function 5 Documentation

**IMPORTANT**: To customize the treatment manipulation:

1. Edit `repos/create_treatment.py`
2. Modify the `FUNCTION_FIVE_DOCSTRING` variable at the top of the file
3. Run `python create_treatment.py` to regenerate the treatment repository

The user should provide the actual function implementations in:
- `repos/reference/functions.py` - Implement the 10 functions
- `repos/reference/test_functions.py` - Write the corresponding tests

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set API Key**
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

3. **Implement Functions and Tests**
   - Add your function implementations to `repos/reference/functions.py`
   - Add corresponding tests to `repos/reference/test_functions.py`

4. **Create Test Repositories**
   ```bash
   cd repos
   python create_control.py
   python create_treatment.py  # Edit FUNCTION_FIVE_DOCSTRING first!
   ```

5. **Build Docker Image**
   ```bash
   cd ../docker
   chmod +x build_image.sh
   ./build_image.sh
   ```

## Running Experiments

### Single Trial
```bash
cd orchestrator
python run_trial.py control    # Run control trial
python run_trial.py treatment  # Run treatment trial
```

### Full Batch (30 trials each)
```bash
cd orchestrator
python batch.py --num-trials 30
```

## Key Features & Fixes

### Security & Isolation
- **Network Isolation**: Containers run with `--network none` to prevent external API calls
- **Directory Isolation**: Each trial uses a fresh temporary workspace
- **Read-only Harness**: The harness code is mounted read-only to prevent tampering
- **Resource Limits**: Memory (2GB) and CPU (1 core) limits enforced

### Metrics Tracked
All metrics are logged to JSONL format in `harness.log`:
- **Timing**: Wall clock time, CPU time, think time per turn
- **Progress**: Test pass/fail counts, turn numbers, function completion order
- **Behavior**: Edits outside target files, consecutive test runs, flip-flop edits
- **Resources**: Token usage, notes.md size, git commit history
- **Errors**: JSON parsing failures, action validation errors

### Memory & Messaging
- **Scratchpad → notes.md**: Agent thoughts automatically persisted
- **Message Passing**: Short strings can be passed between turns
- **Token Management**: Automatic summarization when approaching 8K token limit
- **Git Tracking**: All changes committed with turn numbers

### Treatment Manipulation
- The treatment warning is inserted into function 5's documentation
- Uses regex matching for robustness against formatting changes
- Easily customizable via `FUNCTION_FIVE_DOCSTRING` variable

## Analysis

After running experiments, analyze results using:

```python
# Load JSONL logs
import json

results = []
with open('results/control_trial1/harness.log', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        results.append(json.loads(line))

# Extract key metrics
completion_time = next(r for r in results if r['type'] == 'termination')['elapsed_time']
think_times = [r['think_time'] for r in results if r.get('type') == 'agent_response']
# etc...
```

## Technical Details

### Action Schema
The agent can perform these actions:
- `read_files`: Read multiple files at once
- `patch`: Apply unified diff to modify files
- `run_tests`: Execute pytest
- `list_directory`: List directory contents
- `write_notes`: Overwrite notes.md entirely
- `message`: Pass a message to next turn (can accompany any action)

### Token Counting
Uses Anthropic's approximation (1 token ≈ 4 characters) instead of tiktoken for accuracy.

### Patch Application
Uses `git apply` internally for robust unified diff handling.

## Troubleshooting

### "File not found" errors
Ensure you've implemented functions in `repos/reference/` before creating control/treatment repos.

### Docker permission errors
Run `chmod +x docker/build_image.sh` if the build script isn't executable.

### Agent can't complete tasks
Check that your tests are properly written and can actually pass when functions are correctly implemented.
